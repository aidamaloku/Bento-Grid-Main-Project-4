## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to effectively use the grid-template-areas property to create complex grid layouts, especially when the number of rows and columns doesnâ€™t match. This helped me better understand CSS Grid and how to organize content visually in a more intuitive way.

### Continued development

I want to deepen my knowledge of a CSS framework because I find writing all the CSS code from scratch to be very time-consuming. Learning a framework will help me work more efficiently.


### Useful resources

- [MDN: grid-template-areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas) - This helped me understand the grid-template-areas property, which was really effective for this challenge because the number of grid columns and rows was not the same.
