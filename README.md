## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.





### Continued development

I want to deepen my knowledge of a CSS framework because I find writing all the CSS code from scratch to be very time-consuming. Learning a framework will help me work more efficiently.


### Useful resources

- [MDN: grid-template-areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas) - This helped me understand the grid-template-areas property, which was really effective for this challenge because the number of grid columns and rows was not the same.
